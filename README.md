# Our-World-Of-Text-scripts
Scripts for the Our World of Text website! Fun stuff to upgrade your experience!

To use js files, copy-paste the code into the browser console, or use an extension like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to do it automatically for you

The options are added to the top-left menu!

- rocket.js : Sends a rocket! Watch it go higher and higher! To stop the rocket, select the option again in the menu. ‚ùóDon't move your cursor while the rocket is flying!
- secretmessage.js : Writes a message, if it's long enough it will be just a mess of words... Unless you use the link given to you, to view the text! It uses the API to return the contents of the text.
- teleport.js : Teleports you anywhere, even past the usual maximum boundaries! Type "max" or "min" to go to the maximum/minimum coordinates you can teleport to, using the normal teleport feature.

-pixel art editor.html : Allows you to create and edit your own pixel art as text to paste in OWOT! [Use it online](https://ü¶ä‚ú®üíª.ws/Our-World-Of-Text-scripts/pixel-art-editor.html) or download the HTML file and open it with a browser (large images take a while to load, be patient!)
