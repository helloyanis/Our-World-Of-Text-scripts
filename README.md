# Our-World-Of-Text-scripts
Scripts for the Our World of Text website! Fun stuff to upgrade your experience!

The options are added to the top-left menu!

- rocket.js : Sends a rocket! Watch it go higher and higher! To stop the rocket, select the option again in the menu. ‚ùóDon't move your cursor while the rocket is flying!
- secretmessage.js : Writes a message, if it's long enough it will be just a mess of words... Unless you use the link given to you, to view the text! It uses the API to return the contents of the text.
- teleport.js : Teleports you anywhere, even past the usual maximum boundaries! Type "max" or "min" to go to the maximum/minimum coordinates you can teleport to, using the normal teleport feature.
